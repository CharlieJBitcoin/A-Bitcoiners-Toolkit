# A Bitcoiners Toolkit
A curated list of software and services essential for every bitcoiner.

## Introduction
### Why?
When you start to use Bitcoin, the incentive model for your own personal privacy and security changes. Securing your personal data can seem like a "pointless" endeavour for some, but once who start self-custodying Bitcoin, that attitude inevitably shifts to caring deeply about your own privacy and the security of your stack.

This list is aimed to provide an easy-to-access archive of software and services which any bitcoiner will find useful, aiming to replace many of the free (but detrimental to your privacy) services which are commonly used.

### Who Is This For?
This is aimed at those just starting out on their privacy journey, and those looking to expand their toolkit with new recommendations.
