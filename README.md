## Introduction
### Why?
When you start to use Bitcoin, the incentive model for your own personal privacy and security changes. Securing your personal data can seem like a "pointless" endeavour for some, but once who start self-custodying Bitcoin, that attitude inevitably shifts to caring deeply about your own privacy and the security of your stack.

This list is aimed to provide an easy-to-access archive of software and services which any bitcoiner will find useful, aiming to replace many of the free (but detrimental to your privacy) services which are commonly used.

There are already [lots](#other-curated-privacy-lists) of privacy focused lists out there. What hopefully sets this one apart is the focus on application for bitcoiners. Where possible, links to how these suggestions can be applied to your Bitcoin software stack have been provided 

### Who Is This For?
This is aimed at those just starting out on their privacy journey, and those looking to expand their toolkit with new recommendations.
